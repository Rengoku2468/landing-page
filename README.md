Planned future improvements:

The current layout is fixed-width and desktop-oriented. A future update will include full responsive styling using media queries and flexible grid or flexbox layouts to ensure the page works well on all screen sizes including tablets and mobile devices.

Potential enhancements include: hamburger menu, mobile-friendly button sizing, and collapsible sections for smaller viewports.

This landing page is a starting point for building out a full-featured admin interface and is ideal for practicing front-end layout, clean UI design, and page structure.
